# Professional README Generator

## Description

When working on an application, developers tend to want to spend more time creating their project rather than spending time writing a README file. We all know how important it is to have a README for our projects but we don't like to do them so much. 

There is a quick solution to that problem. 

I decided to cut down my time creating a README file by asking a few questions in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and having one generated for me. It looks professional and clean and I can get back to doing the stuff that I love in no time at all. 

Through creating this application, I learned how to download node packages to use in my program. I learned how to write files and how to generate client-side applications from within the command-line. I have a better grasps of what dependencies are and how to interconnect mulitple files to break up code and make it readable and efficient.
